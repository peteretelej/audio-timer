# Audio Timer

Audio Timer is a simple and intuitive web application that allows you to create custom timers with audio notifications. When a timer reaches the end of its countdown, it plays any message you give it using the SpeechSynthesis API. 

This app is perfect for managing tasks, workouts, or any activities that require timed audio alerts.

## Features
- Create multiple custom timers
- Set a custom audio message for each timer
- Timers are saved in IndexedDB for state persistence
- Audio alerts using the SpeechSynthesis API
- Built with Svelte & Astro
